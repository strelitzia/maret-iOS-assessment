# Glucode Interview Assignment

Hi there! 

One of our developers, Steve, fell sick in the middle of completing a feature. We need your help to finish things off.

Steve was tasked with building a way to display some interesting facts about our engineers when he fell sick. He was able to finish the list of questions (with some bugs) but never got to implementing the profile view or finishing the ordering.

That's where you come in.
For the next **72 hours** you will have free reign to finish off what Steve started, any commits after that will be ignored.


# Overview
- You are free to change whatever you need.
- You will have 72 hours (3 days) within which you can make changes to the codebase.
- Below you will find a list of main tasks, with their detail further below.
- If the task has related designs you will find them in a filegroup in the project within the ***Aditional Info*** group.

### Main tasks
- [x] There are a total of **3 known** bugs, ranging from simple to complex. Fix the bugs.
- [x] Create and display a reusable component, which could be used for the profile view.
- [x] Finish implementing the mechanism to order the list of engineers and add tests.

> You can complete these tasks in any order you like, but starting with one or two bugs might be a good way to get into the codebase.
